   <h1>About </h1><hr>
   Welcome to Hacking torx!!, this site was set up over 2 years ago as a safe place for internet users to learn the art of hacking in a controlled environment, teaching the most common flaws in internet security.
   <br /><br />
   Whilst the majority of internet users invoke the services of the World Wide Web for legitimate reasons, there are many who seek to defraud and cheat their way around our public network using hacking techniques.
   Hackingtorx.co.uk specialises in the art of security exploitation in an effort to teach users of the Internet how to protect themselves and their websites from these unscrupulous individuals. Our aim is far
   from malicious. We hope to educate the average web user into being more aware of the security threats around them and make web developers think more carefully about the security of the software they produce.
